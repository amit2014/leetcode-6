# Requirements
1) Have MySQL installed and create a database called `leetcode`.
2) Put your MySQL database connection and Leetcode details in `config.ini` (a lot of SQL questions are premium on Leetcode).

The `config.ini` should look like this:
```
[mysql]
host = localhost
database = leetcode
user = root
password = password

[leetcode]
user = yrom1
password = ...
```
